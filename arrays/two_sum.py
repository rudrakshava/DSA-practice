# Problem: Two Sum
# Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, 
# return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

def two_sum(nums, target):
    lookup = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        diff = target - num
        if diff in lookup:
            return [lookup[diff], i]
        lookup[num] = i

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
    target = 9
    print(two_sum(nums, target))  # Output: [0, 1]
